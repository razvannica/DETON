                            <p>Welcome to our site!</p>
                            <p>Our app has the purpose of being a detention monitoring tool.</p>
                            <p>This web application was designed on the idea of helping the prison staff to keep track on the visits of the convicts of a set prison.</p>
                            <p>A prison is a facility used to punish the people that have broken the law and at the same time help them reintegrate in the society as peaceful,
                                law-abiding and productive citizens.</p>
                            <p>Many people break the law because of different kinds of reasons, but that doesn't have to leave a mark on them as they will return to society and
                                the main purpose of a prison is to make sure that after a person leaves he will obey the law and try to not return there.</p>
                            <p>One of a convicts right is the right to visits. This is one of many methods that are used so that convicts reflect on their mistakes and make their life in prison easier. </p>
                            <p>By seeing the suffering they have done to their loved ones and by receiving their love and thoughts they will reflect and may change for the better.</p>
                            <p>That's why this app was developed with the sole thought and reason so that people that get out of prison will be better people and will realise their mistakes,
                                because having an app that can simplify and make the visiting system more efficient, can help the prison staff, but more importantly the convicts and their loved ones.</p>
